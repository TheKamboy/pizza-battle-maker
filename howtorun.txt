It is simple.

Make sure Python is in your PATH. There is tutorials online to help you do it. Or, if you haven't installed Python yet, make sure
on the installer you click "Add Python to environment variables".

If that is done, open your terminal (Windows 11) or CMD (Typing cmd.exe into address bar, Windows 10 or lower I think) and
type in "python main.py" to run the game.
